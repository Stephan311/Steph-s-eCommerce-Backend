# Steph-s-eCommerce-Backend

In this assignment, I created a backend for an eCommerce store that seems to sell clothing. This one does it all. I can add products, tags, and categories. I can delte products, tags, and categories, aswell as viewing all products, tags, and categories as a whole or by their respective IDs. I have also joined tables so that when products are viewed, we can view the category and product tags associated with them. The same goes when viweing product tags and categories. Corresponding Data can be seen connected to it.
